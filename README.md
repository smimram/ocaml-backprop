Backpropagation in OCaml
========================

Trying to implement backpropagation in OCaml using monads. I started with a
[first implementation of neural networks](https://github.com/smimram/ocaml-nn/)
which was traditional but a bit heavy to my taste, which motivated me to try a
more structured approach based on monadic-like approach (although there are no
monads in the end).
